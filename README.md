# Switcheo Code Challenge

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the Switcheo Code Challenge. The challenge consists of three problems designed to test various aspects of software development skills.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── problem1/
│   └── index.js
├── problem2-form/
│   └── [React form files]
├── problem3/
│   ├── messy.ts
│   └── fixed.ts
└── README.md
```

Each problem has its own directory containing the solution files.

## Problems

### Problem 1: JavaScript Implementation

- File: `problem1/index.js`
- Description: This problem is solved using a single JavaScript file.

### Problem 2: React Form

- Directory: `problem2-form/`
- Description: This is a React form setup.
- Running the solution:
  1. Navigate to the `problem2-form` directory
  2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
  4. Go to http://localhost:5173

### Problem 3: Code Improvement

- Files:
  - `problem3/messy.ts`: Original code with comments for improvement
  - `problem3/fixed.ts`: Updated and improved code
- Description: This problem focuses on code improvement and refactoring.

## Running the Solutions

### Problem 1

No specific instructions required to run. You can execute the JavaScript file using Node.js if needed.

### Problem 2

To run the React form locally:

1. Navigate to the `problem2-form` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`)

Alternatively, you can view the live version at [prob3m.netlify.app](https://prob3m.netlify.app)

### Problem 3

The TypeScript files in Problem 3 don't require execution. They demonstrate code improvement from `messy.ts` to `fixed.ts`.
